# KittyCatS Viewer

## What is the KittyCatS Viewer?
This is a simple Java application written in the Processing IDE to generate an image of a KittyCat.

## Why another tool for previewing KittyCatS?

This was initially just going to be a little personal project for myself, but after multiple people seemed interested in it, I have decided to make it public and open source.

Often, people share trait information about their KittyCatS such as the following.

```
Fur: Genesis - Bandit II
Eyes: Genesis Sunflower (Shape: Curious | Pupil: Big)
Shade: Natural
Tail: Genesis
Ears: Genesis
Whiskers: Silver (Shape: Guitar)
```

Inspired by the great Build-A-Cat tool at http://tad-carlucci.com/Build-a-Cat/, I have decided to make a similar version which allows the user to simply select trait info like shown above and then copy it to their clipboard.

## Usage

1. Start the program.
2. Make sure the trait info is in the exact format as shown above and then select the trait info and copy it to your clipboard.
3. The program will automatically detect a cliboard update and will look for the different traits. If it has found all of them, it will begin retrieving the images from the KittyCatS server and assemble them, similar to how Build-A-Cat works. You can check the progress by looking at the title bar of the program.
